\question \textbf{7} \textbf{a}\\

We want to prove that the function is continuous on the interval $[0,1]$.\\

Let ${x_n}$ be a sequence in $[0,1]$ such that $x_n \to x_0 \in [0, 1]$. By the sum and product properties of convergent
sequences, we have

\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt{x_n}\\
&= \sqrt{x_0} \\ 
&= f(x_0)
\end{align*}

Thus, $f$ is continuous at $x_0$.\\

\textbf{b}\\

We want to prove that the function is uniformly continuous on the interval $[0,1]$.\\

Let ${u_n}$ and ${v_n}$ be sequences in $[0, 1]$ such that

\[lim_{n \to \infty} [u_n - v_n] = 0\]

We want to prove that 

\[lim_{n \to \infty} |f(u_n) - f(v_n)| = 0\]

We shall prove so by arguing the contradition. Suppose that the differences between the two limits is not equal
to 0. Then, thre must exist some $\epsilon > 0$ such that

\[|f(u_n) - f(v_n)| \geq \epsilon\]

for all $n$.\\

We know, however, that the domain of $f$ is $[0, 1]$. By the Sequential Compactness Theorem,
there exists a subsequence ${u_{n_k}}$ of ${u_{n}}$ and a point $x_0$ in $[0, 1]$ such that

\[lim_{k \to \infty} u_{n_k} = x_0\]

Similarly, we also conclude that there exists a subsequence ${v_{n_k}}$ of ${v_{n}}$ and a 
point $x_0$ in $[0, 1]$ such that

\[lim_{k \to \infty} v_{n_k} = x_0\]

Knowing, however, that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$, we have 

\[f(u_{n_k}) = f(x_0) = f(v_{n_k})\]

for all $k$. Thus, we have

\[|f(u_{n_k}) - f(v_{n_k})| = 0\]

for all $k$.\\

This contradicts our assumption that there exists some $\epsilon > 0$ such that

\[|f(u_n) - f(v_n)| \geq \epsilon\]

for all $n$. Thus, we have proved that the function is uniformly continuous on the interval $[0, 1]$.\\

\textbf{c}\\

We want to prove that the function is not Lipschitz. We prove by contradiction


Suppose there $\exists C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq C|x - y|$ for any $x, y \in [0, 1]$. 

\begin{align*}
    |\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y}| &\leq C|x - y| = C|\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y}||\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}|\\
    1 &\leq C|\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}|\\
    \frac{1}{c} &\leq |\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}|
\end{align*}

For any $x, y \in [0, 1]$ where $x \neq y$. However, this cannot be true. For instance, let $y = 0$
and $x = \frac{1}{c + 1}$. Since $\frac{1}{c} > \frac{1}{c + 1}$, $\frac{1}{c} > \sqrt{\frac{1}{c + 1}}$. This is 
a contradiction to our equation above. Thus, we have proved that the function is not Lipschitz.\\
