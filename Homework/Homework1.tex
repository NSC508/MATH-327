\question Recall that in the textbook, a function f : A $\rightarrow$ B is said to be
invertible f is one-to-one and onto. (This is also called bijection in some literature.)
Show that a function f : A $\rightarrow$ B is invertible if and only if there is a function g :
B $\rightarrow$ A such that g $\circ$ f = identity function on A and f $\circ$ g = identity 
function on B.

A function $F$ is called the identity function given that $F(x) = x$. We are given that $f(g(x)) 
= x$ and $g(f(x)) = x$. We want to prove that $f$ is both one-to-one and onto. 

Let $f(g(x)) = f(g(y))$. Given that this is the identity function, we know that $f(g(x)) = x$ 
and $f(g(y)) = y$. As such, $x = y$. So, $f(g(x))$ is one-to-one. 

We know that $f(g(x)) = x$. Let $y \in B$. We want to show that for some $x \in A$, $f(g(x)) = y$.
Since $f(g(x))$ is the identity function, we know that $f(g(y)) = y$. As such, when $x = y$, 
$f(g(x)) = y$. So, $f(g(x))$ is onto.

\question Let f : A $\rightarrow$ B and g : B $\rightarrow$ C be functions.\\
(a) Prove that f and g are injective, then so is g $\circ$ f. Test

(b) Suppose g $\circ$ f is surjective. Does it follow that f is surjective?

(c) Suppose g $\circ$ f is surjective. Does it follow that g is surjective?
